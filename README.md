µcruler
=======

inspired by dave jone's [µruler](http://www.eevblog.com/projects/uruler/) and adafruit's [PCB ruler](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1554)

As the project started on mikrocontroller.net, the next-best name µc-ruler was taken. It's currently too similar to »µruler«, but I couldn't figure out a better one until now.

## Footprints

In contrast to many other projects, I re-created the footprints from their datasheets. Therefore, they don't represent the needed size for soldering on your PCB, but the is-size of the package.

## Tables

All tables on the backside were created with the best knowledge I had, although I can't guarantee they are always 100% perfect and without any errors.

Especially the PCB trace thickness depends on so many factors that there can't be an universal rule. The values should match normal applications with some safety margin, but if you really need calculations exactly I recommend the [Saturn PCB Toolkit](http://www.saturnpcb.com/pcb_toolkit.htm).
